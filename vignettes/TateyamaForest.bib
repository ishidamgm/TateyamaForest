	abstract = {• Context In long-term forest monitoring, tree crown condition has been visually rated to diagnose tree vigor and forest condition. However, visual estimates are subjective. A semiautomatic image analysis system, called {CROCO}, was developed to estimate crown condition quantitatively. {CROCO} calculates a {DSO} value which decrease with increasing crown transparency. • Aims This study aims to verify visual estimates objectively using {CROCO} and to assess characteristics of visual estimates and {DSO} values by comparing the effectiveness as indicators of radial growth. • Methods Crown condition of Abies mariesii was visually rated using a vitality index, and {DSO} values of the same trees were calculated. • Results When the top of the tree was intact, the trees with a higher vitality index showed a significantly higher {DSO}. Vitality index showed the strongest relationship with {DBH} increment for 8 years. {DSO} had a significant relationship with {DBH} increment by adding information of the crown top condition. • Conclusion Analysis of tree crown images is effective to verify visual estimates. Vitality index is a synthetic index involving factors affecting radial growth. {DSO} could be utilized similarly to vitality index, as an indicator of radial growth, by addition of information on crown size and/or shape.},

	abstract = {In the subalpine areas of the snowy regions of Japan (the Japan Sea side), there are some mountains with no or very small stands of Abies mariesii, although this species dominates the subalpine coniferous forests of the region. In order to discuss the cause and process of this phenomenon, present horizontal and vertical ranges, as well as physiographic conditions, of the A. mariesii forest were examined in detail on the mountains in the Tohoku District. Sites in the subalpine zone were classified into two types: 'azonal sites' which should be excluded from the habitat of A. mariesii because of their edaphic or small-scale climatic properties, and 'zonal sites'. Mountains with vast less-inclined zonal sites generally had well developed stands of A. mariesii forest. On the mountains with only small, solitary stands of A. mariesii, the distribution was limited to flats or slightly indined slopes at relatively low altitudes. These less-inclined zonal sites were regarded as an important habitat for the A. mariesii forest in the Hypsithermal period and the extent of these sites controls the extent of the stands in that period and the success of the subsequent range expansion of the forest.},

	abstract = {The effects of air pollution on the growth of mountain trees were investigated at Buna-daira (1,180 m a.s.l.), about half the way up Mt. Tateyama, located in Japan. Every year, about 1 million tourists are transported by highland buses through the Tateyama-Kurobe Alpine route. Since the route opened in 1971, some tree species along the road have declined and have been blighted, suggesting that bus exhaust was the cause. However, the level of regional and long-range transboundary air pollution has also increased significantly over the last few decades. The atmospheric {NO}2 concentration at the roadside in the forest was highly correlated with the traffic density of buses and penetration of the exhaust into the forest was detected. However, the maximum average {NO}2 concentration was lower than 3.5 ppbv during the peak traffic period in the year. At Buna-daira, the total stem cross-sectional area at breast height ({BA}) of the forest was nearly unchanged from 1999 to 2006, but the {BA} of Fagus crenata decreased 10\% and that of Cryptomeria japonica increased 6\%. Neither tree growth nor tree death was significantly correlated with distance from the road. The cause of the decline of F. crenata could not be attributed to the effects of road, i. e., air pollution emitted from the buses or edge effects of the road. This area was more affected by regional, long-range transport of air pollution (O3, {SO}2, etc.). The average atmospheric O3 concentration in autumn was higher than 40 ppbv and the recent increase in the O3 concentration may be an important factor of F. crenata decline through the changes in the interspecific relationships between F. crenata and C. japonica, O3 sensitive and tolerant species, respectively. © 2008 The Ecological Society of Japan.},

	abstract = {Although the European Alps are one of the most investigated regions worldwide, maps depicting climate change by means of climate classiﬁcation are still not-existent. To contribute to this topic, a time series of very high resolution (30 arc-seconds) maps of the well-known Köppen-Geiger climate classiﬁcation is presented. The maps cover the greater Alpine region located within the geographical domain of 4 to 19 degrees longitude and 43 to 49 degrees latitude. Gridded monthly data were selected to compile climate maps within this region. Observations for the period 1800–2010 were taken from the historical instrumental climatological surface time series of the greater Alpine region, HISTALP. Projected climate data for the period 2011–2100 were taken, as an example, from the Rossby Centre regional atmospheric model RCA4. Temperature ﬁelds were spatially disaggregated by applying the observed seasonal cycle of the environmental lapse rate. The main results of this study are, therefore, 366 observed and predicted (two scenarios) very high resolution Köppen-Geiger climate maps of the greater Alpine region covering the period 1800–2100. Digital data, as well as animated maps, showing the shift of the climate zones are provided on the following website http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at. Furthermore, the relationship between the KöppenGeiger climate classiﬁcation and the altitudinal belts of the Alps is demonstrated by calculating the boundaries of the climate zones, i.e. the deciduous forest line, the mixed forest line, the forest and tree line (timber line) and the snow line. The mean altitude of the potential timber line in the greater Alpine region, for example, was calculated to be 1730 m by the end of the 19th century, 1880 m by the end of the 20th century and to lie between 2120 and 2820 m by the end of the 21st century. The latter altitudes were projected for the greenhouse gas scenarios RCP 2.6 (best case) and RCP 8.5 (worst case). The altitude of the timber line (and the other boundaries of the altitudinal belts) is generally higher in the Western Alps, showing a clear west-east slope.},

	annote = {Global warming and the stronger regional temperature trends recently recorded over the European Alps have triggered several biological and physical dynamics in high-altitude environments. We defined the present treeline altitude in three valleys of a region in the western Italian Alps and reconstructed the past treeline position for the \_\_last three centuries\_\_ in a nearly undisturbed site by means of a \_\_dendrochronological\_\_ approach. We found that the treeline altitude in this region is mainly controlled by human impacts and geomorphological factors. The reconstruction of the altitudinal dynamics at the study site reveals that the \_\_treeline shifted upwards of 115 m over the period 1901–2000, reaching the altitude of 2505 m in 2000 and 2515 m in 2008\_\_. The recent treeline shift and the acceleration of tree colonization rates in the alpine belt can be mainly ascribed to the climatic input. However, we point out the increasing role of geomorphological factors in controlling the future treeline position and colonization patterns in high mountains. 　年輪年代学によって最近の3世紀の森林限界が上昇していることを明らかにした
